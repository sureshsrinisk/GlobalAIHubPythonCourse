# GlobalAIHubPythonCourse

This is a course home work and project assignment for the course Introduction to Python Programming 
conducted by GlobalAI. It is a five days certification programme was conducted during the month of feb 2021 from 1st to 5th of calender days.
Each session was about 2 hrs. The classes were taken by Ms.Tuana Celik from Bristol. This is her first online streaming as she said.
I was glad to attend Ms.Tuana's cohort. Her Pronounciation, explanation and teaching methodology was clear and concise.
Thanks to GlobalAI for such good initiative.
